Setup:

I downloaded the 'small' educational dataset from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ as specified in the project steps.

4 .csv files were included. movies, links, tags, and ratings.
From looking at the data, it looks like movie-id is how information is kept about which movie is being talked about.

"Formulate one or two ideas on how the combination of ratings and tags by users helps the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis"
